Question 1: Longest mountain in array

Let's call any (contiguous) subarray B (of A) a mountain if the following properties hold:

B.length >= 3
There exists some 0 < i < B.length - 1 such that B[0] < B[1] < ... B[i-1] < B[i] > B[i+1] > ... > B[B.length - 1]
(Note that B could be any subarray of A, including the entire array A.)

Given an array A of integers, return the length of the longest mountain. 

Return 0 if there is no mountain.

Example 1:

Input: [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
Example 2:

Input: [2,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no mountain.
Note:

0 <= A.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] <= 10000
Follow up:

Can you solve it using only one pass?
Can you solve it in O(1) space?

Question 2: Flip string to Monotone increasing

A string of '0's and '1's is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of '0's (possibly 0), followed by some number of '1's (also possibly 0.)

We are given a string S of '0's and '1's, and we may flip any '0' to a '1' or a '1' to a '0'.

Return the minimum number of flips to make S monotone increasing.

 

Example 1:

Input: "00110"
Output: 1
Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.
Example 2:

Input: "010110"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.
Example 3:

Input: "00011000"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 00000000.
 

Note:

1. 1 <= S.length <= 20000
2. S only consists of '0' and '1' characters.
