Consider an array of n ticket prices, tickets.
      A number, m, is defined as the size of some subsequence, s, of tickets where each element covers an unbroken range of integers.
      
      That is to say, if you were to sort the elements in s,
        the absolute difference between any elements j and j + 1 would be either 0 or 1.
      
      For example, tickets = [8, 5, 4, 8, 4] gives us sorted subsequences {4, 4, 5} and {8, 8};
         these subsequences have m values of 3 and 2, respectively.

     Complete the function MaxSequence below. 
        The function must return an integer that denotes the maximum possible value of m.

        MaxSequence has the following parameter(s):
            tickets[tickets[0],...tickets[n-1]]:  an array of integers

        Constraints
        1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000
        1 ≤ tickets[i] ≤ 100000000
