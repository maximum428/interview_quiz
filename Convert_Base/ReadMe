Write a program to print Binary representation of a given number.

Quick notes:
(n&~(n-1)) always return the binary number containing the rightmost set bit as 1. if N = 12 (1100) then it will return 4 (100). Here log2 will return, 
the number of times we can express that number in a power of two. For all binary numbers containing only the rightmost set bit as 1 like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32…. 
Find that position of rightmost set bit is always equal to log2(Number) + 1.


Position of rightmost set bit:
Write a function to return the position of the first 1 from right to left, in the binary representation of an integer.
Example:
Input: n = 18
Output: 2
Explanation: Binary Representation of 18 is 010010, hence position of first set bit from right is 2.

Input:  n = 19
Output: 1
Explanation: Binary Representation of 19 is 010011, hence position of first set bit from right is 1.
