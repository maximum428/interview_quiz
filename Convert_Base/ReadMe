Write a program to print Binary representation of a given number.

Quick notes:
(n&~(n-1)) always return the binary number containing the rightmost set bit as 1. if N = 12 (1100) then it will return 4 (100). Here log2 will return, 
the number of times we can express that number in a power of two. For all binary numbers containing only the rightmost set bit as 1 like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32â€¦. 
Find that position of rightmost set bit is always equal to log2(Number) + 1.
