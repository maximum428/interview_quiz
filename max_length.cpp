Consider an array of n ticket prices, tickets. A number, m, is defined as the size of some subsequence of tickets, s, where each element covers an unbroken range of integers.  
That is, if the elements in s are sorted, the absolute difference between any elements j and j + 1 is either 0 or 1.  Determine the maximum length of a subsquence chosen from the tickets array.
